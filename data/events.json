It premiered at Chicago&#8217;s Northlight Theatre in 2001 and was then produced Off-Broadway in March 2002. Since then it has had numerous productions both in the United States and internationally.<\/p>\n<p>The story explores a five-year relationship between Jamie Wellerstein, a rising novelist, and Cathy Hiatt, a struggling actress. The show uses a form of storytelling in which Cathy&#8217;s story is told in reverse chronological order (beginning the show at the end of the marriage), and Jamie&#8217;s is told in chronological order (starting just after the couple have first met). The characters do not directly interact except for a wedding song in the middle as their timelines intersect.<\/p>\n","startDate":"2018-09-06","endDate":"2018-09-09","dates":["2018-09-06T19:30","2018-09-07T19:30","2018-09-08T19:30","2018-09-09T14:30"],"location":"Amelia Musical Playhouse","url":"http:\/\/www.ameliamusicalplayhouse.com\/last-5-years\/","facebookUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1704127243037022\/","category":"Musicals","eventType":"TheaterEvent"},{"id":794,"name":"This Girl Laughs, This Girl Cries, This Girl Does Nothing","description":"<p>Three young sisters are left in a forest by their woodcutter father and forced to find their own way in the world.
